# Fire Incidents During Major Celebrations Project

## Project Background
As a Data Analyst specialising in public safety, I analysed fire incident data in London spanning 2009 to 2024. The dataset includes details on the date of the incidents, boroughs where they occurred, property types involved, ignition sources, and total incident counts during major events like Diwali, Halloween, Bonfire Night (Guy Fawkes), and Christmas. The objective of this analysis was to uncover trends in fire incidents, identify high-risk boroughs and ignition sources, and provide actionable recommendations to support fire prevention strategies, inform public awareness campaigns, and improve resource allocation.

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of fire incident trends in London, focusing on seasonal and event-driven patterns, borough-specific hotspots, property types, and ignition sources. Key findings include:
  - Event-Driven Incidents: Bonfire Night consistently accounts for the highest number of incidents, making up 51% of total fire activity during events.
  - Declining Trends: Overall fire incidents have declined since 2009, with spikes still occurring around seasonal events such as Guy Fawkes and Christmas.
   - Borough Hotspots: Tower Hamlets, Westminster, and Southwark experience the highest number of incidents, indicating specific borough-level risks.
  - Ignition Sources: Fireworks are the most common cause of fire incidents during Diwali and Guy Fawkes, while electrical faults dominate Christmas-related incidents.
  - Property Types: Dwellings account for 32% of all incidents, followed by outdoor structures and road vehicles.

## Recommendations
### 1. Targeted Awareness Campaigns:
  - Diwali: Promote safe firework use and alternatives (e.g., LED diyas).
  - Guy Fawkes: Encourage attendance at organised displays and teach bonfire safety.
  - Halloween: Promote flame-resistant decorations and costumes.
  - Christmas: Highlight risks of electrical fires and heating equipment.

### 2. Borough-Specific Strategies:
  - Focus on high-risk boroughs like Tower Hamlets, Westminster, and Southwark.
  - Conduct local workshops, distribute safety materials, and collaborate with community leaders.

### 3. Stricter Firework Regulations:
  - Limit sale of high-grade fireworks to licensed organisers.
  - Enforce stricter usage hours during Diwali and Guy Fawkes.

### 4. Seasonal Resource Deployment:
  - Pre-position firefighting resources in high-risk boroughs during November and December.
  - Increase emergency response capacity around peak dates.

### 5. Ignition Source Mitigation:
  - Educate households on cooker safety and electrical maintenance.
  - Promote fire-safe practices for cigarettes and naked flames.

## Key Questions for Stakeholders
1. How can public safety campaigns be tailored to address high-risk ignition sources and borough-specific trends?
2. What additional resources are required to improve emergency response times during peak periods?
3. Should stricter firework regulations be implemented, and what impact might they have on reducing incidents?

## Assumptions and Caveats
  - Data Source: The analysis relies on data from the Greater London Authority, which may not capture all fire incidents, especially minor unreported events.
  - Ignition Sources: Certain sources (e.g., fireworks or naked flames) may be underreported due to incomplete data or misclassification.
- Borough-Level Insights: Socio-economic factors and population density are not included in this analysis but could provide additional context for borough-level trends.
